Matt Smiths Mine Profiter
=========================

I've developed this as my first script for RSBot. (<a href="http://www.powerbot.com/"> http://www.powerbot.com/ </a>)
I am looking for honest reviews of my code as to improve my ability to write bots in Java for RSBot V5.


- Bot Tasks
-----------

1. Mines South of Lumbridge for 14 Copper and 14 Tin.
2. Smelts into Bronze in Lumbridge Furnace.
3. Drops all Ingots in bank. Repeats Step 1 Until a random amount of Ingots, then continues below.
4. Runs to GrandExchange.
5. Sells all Ingots at Current Price.
6. Runs back to Lumbridge mine and Repeats process
